    "In the context of protecting the agenda of those in power, the term \"chien de garde\" (or \"guard dog\") in journalism refers to media outlets or journalists who act in the interests of the powerful, rather than serving the public. This concept is the opposite of the traditional watchdog role, as these \"guard dogs\" may:\n",

    "4. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare the findings across different outlets and types of media to identify patterns and variations in the use of tactics.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate the potential influence of these tactics on public opinion by examining audience reactions, social media discussions, and opinion polls.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tactic Identification**: A comprehensive list of tactics used by news outlets to protect the agendas of the powerful, with detailed descriptions and examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Media Profiles**: Profiles of different news outlets, highlighting their use of these tactics and their alignment with powerful interests.\n",
