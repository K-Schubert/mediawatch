MediawatCH is an association I co-founded to tackle bias identification in Swiss media through human and AI analysis.

The app allows users to manully label media articles from Swiss newspapers according to a theoretical framework we are developing. This data is used to train models which can automate article analysis and bias detection. We also aim to detect specific wording/phrasing in media articles in divisive contexts which deviates from international law standards and glossaries.

We currently cover a variety of swiss newspapers (RTS, Le Courrier, Le Temps, Le Matin, 20 Minutes, etc.), a french newspaper (Le Monde), and aim to cover the RTS daily news broadcast (19h30) as well as RTS radio.

## Introduction

In the context of protecting the agenda of those in power, the term "chien de garde" (or "guard dog") in journalism refers to media outlets or journalists who act in the interests of the powerful, rather than serving the public. This concept is the opposite of the traditional watchdog role, as these "guard dogs" may:

- Promote the interests of the powerful: They may prioritize stories that align with the agendas of those in power, often neglecting or downplaying issues that could be detrimental to these interests.

- Suppress critical information: They may ignore, underreport, or discredit information and perspectives that could challenge or undermine the status quo or the power of influential entities.

- Propagate propaganda: They might disseminate biased or misleading information to shape public opinion in favor of the powerful, often blurring the line between journalism and public relations.

- Maintain the status quo: By focusing on narratives that reinforce existing power structures and social hierarchies, they contribute to the preservation of these structures.

This concept critiques the potential for media to become complicit in maintaining power dynamics and failing to serve the broader public interest. It highlights the tension between journalistic integrity and the influence of powerful stakeholders on media content and practices.

## Tactics

Media outlets or journalists who act as "chiens de garde" (guard dogs) protecting the agenda of the powerful may use various tactics to shape public perception and influence narratives. Here are some of the common tactics employed (list is work in progress):

- Passive Voice

Purpose: To obscure the subject responsible for an action, thereby diminishing accountability.

Example: "Mistakes were made" instead of "The company made mistakes."

- Guided Questions

Purpose: To lead the audience to a predetermined conclusion or to frame an issue in a specific way.

Example: "Don't you think that the new policy will benefit the economy?" instead of "What are the potential impacts of the new policy?"

- Selective Reporting

Purpose: To highlight certain information while ignoring other relevant facts, shaping the narrative to favor the powerful.

Example: Focusing extensively on the economic benefits of a new law while ignoring its negative social impacts.

- Euphemisms

Purpose: To downplay or soften the perception of negative actions or outcomes.

Example: Using "collateral damage" to refer to civilian casualties in a military operation.

- Framing

Purpose: To present information in a way that influences interpretation and opinion.

Example: Describing a protest as a "riot" versus a "demonstration" can evoke different responses from the audience.

- Omission

Purpose: To leave out crucial information that might present the powerful in a negative light.

Example: Reporting on a company's financial success without mentioning its environmental violations.

- Cherry-Picking Data

Purpose: To select specific data points that support a particular narrative while ignoring data that contradicts it.

Example: Highlighting a temporary drop in unemployment rates without discussing the overall trend of increasing job insecurity.

- Loaded Language

Purpose: To use emotionally charged words to influence audience perception.

Example: Referring to a policy as "radical" or "extreme" to create a negative impression.

- Ad Hominem Attacks

Purpose: To discredit critics or opposition by attacking their character rather than addressing their arguments.

Example: Labeling a whistleblower as "disgruntled" or "unreliable" instead of addressing the substance of their claims.

- False Balance

Purpose: To present two sides of an issue as equally valid, even when the evidence heavily supports one side.

Example: Giving equal time to climate change scientists and climate change deniers, despite the overwhelming scientific consensus.

- Sensationalism

Purpose: To use shocking or sensational headlines and stories to attract attention, often at the expense of accuracy and depth.

Example: "Government Under Siege by Angry Mobs" instead of "Peaceful Protesters Rally for Change."

- Astroturfing

Purpose: To create the illusion of grassroots support for a cause that is actually orchestrated by powerful interests.

Example: Coordinating fake social media campaigns to simulate public support for a controversial policy.

- Repetition

Purpose: To reinforce a particular message or narrative by repeating it frequently.

Example: Constantly repeating a slogan or catchphrase associated with a policy or leader to embed it in the public consciousness.

- Appeal to Authority

Purpose: To strengthen an argument by citing authoritative figures or institutions that support the powerful's agenda.

Example: "Experts agree that this policy is necessary," without specifying which experts or the basis of their agreement.

- Scapegoating

Purpose: To divert blame or criticism by attributing problems to a convenient target, often a minority group or external entity.

Example: Blaming economic woes on immigrants or foreign competitors rather than domestic policy failures.

- Straw Man Argument

Purpose: To misrepresent or oversimplify an opponent's position, making it easier to attack.

Example: "Opponents of this policy want to abandon progress," ignoring the nuanced arguments of critics.

- Glittering Generalities

Purpose: To use vague, emotionally appealing phrases that lack substantive content but create a positive impression.

Example: Promising "a brighter future" without providing specific plans or actions.

- Deflection

Purpose: To avoid addressing uncomfortable questions or criticisms by shifting the focus to a different issue.

Example: When asked about corruption, a politician responds by talking about their achievements in a completely different area.

- Echo Chambers

Purpose: To reinforce existing beliefs by ensuring that people are exposed only to information that confirms their views.

Example: Media outlets tailoring content to fit the biases and preferences of their audience, creating a feedback loop.

- Tokenism

Purpose: To give the appearance of inclusivity or reform by making superficial changes while maintaining the status quo.

Example: Highlighting a few minority voices or implementing minor policy tweaks while ignoring systemic issues.

- Minimization

Purpose: To downplay the severity or significance of an issue or event.

Example: Referring to a major environmental disaster as a "minor spill."

- Use of Flawed Studies

Purpose: To present biased or poorly conducted research as credible to support a specific agenda.

Example: Citing industry-funded studies that show no harm from a product known to be dangerous.

- Smokescreening

Purpose: To obscure the truth by overwhelming the audience with irrelevant information.

Example: Flooding news cycles with minor updates to drown out significant but unfavorable reports.

- Appeal to Emotion

Purpose: To manipulate audience feelings rather than using logical arguments.

Example: Using heart-wrenching stories to garner support for a policy without discussing its broader implications.

- Rebranding Negative Concepts

Purpose: To change the language used to describe a controversial policy to make it more palatable.

Example: Referring to "tax cuts for the wealthy" as "tax relief."

- Hasty Generalizations

Purpose: To make broad claims based on limited evidence to mislead the audience.

Example: Using an isolated incident to justify widespread policy changes.

- Marginalization

Purpose: To sideline or discredit voices that challenge the dominant narrative.

Example: Labeling critics as "fringe" or "extremists" to delegitimize their viewpoints.


- Strategic Ambiguity

Purpose: To be deliberately vague to avoid accountability or detailed scrutiny.

Example: Announcing a policy with general statements without specifying the concrete measures or implications.

- Discrediting Whistleblowers

Purpose: To undermine the credibility of those who expose misconduct.

Example: Portraying whistleblowers as disgruntled employees or traitors.

- False Dilemma

Purpose: To present a situation as having only two choices, ignoring other viable options.

Example: "Either we implement this policy or face economic ruin," disregarding alternative solutions.

- Red Herring

Purpose: To introduce irrelevant information to distract from the main issue.

Example: Bringing up past scandals or unrelated issues during discussions of current policy failures.

- False Attribution

Purpose: To attribute statements or statistics to credible sources that did not actually provide them.

Example: Claiming that "studies show" a certain fact without referencing specific, credible studies.

These tactics can subtly manipulate public perception, maintaining the power of influential entities while undermining the role of the media as an independent watchdog.

## Goals

The goal of this project is to identify how and which news outlets use the aforementioned tactics to protect the agenda of those in power in major news stories. By systematically analyzing news content, we aim to uncover the prevalence and patterns of these tactics in contemporary journalism. This analysis will help us understand the extent to which media outlets act as "chiens de garde" (guard dogs) rather than independent watchdogs, influencing public perception and maintaining existing power structures.

- Identify Tactics: To catalog and define the specific tactics used by news outlets to shape narratives in favor of powerful interests.

- Analyze News Content: To perform a detailed content analysis of major news stories across different media outlets, looking for the presence and frequency of these tactics.

- Compare Outlets: To compare and contrast how various news organizations employ these tactics, identifying which outlets are most complicit in protecting powerful agendas.

- Understand Impact: To assess the impact of these tactics on public opinion and discourse, determining how they influence perceptions of key issues and events.

## Methodology

- Selection of News Outlets: Choose a diverse range of media outlets, including mainstream, independent, and alternative sources, to ensure a comprehensive analysis.

- Content Sampling: Collect a representative sample of news articles, broadcasts, and digital content covering major news events over a specific period.

- Coding and Analysis: Develop a coding scheme to identify and categorize the use of different tactics in the news content. Use qualitative and quantitative methods to analyze the data.
